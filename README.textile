h1. Indowebster Direct URL Extractor

idws.py is simple script that will extract direct download url and it's filename from any given indowebster's download url

h2. Why?

I'm tired from the complicated step just to get the URL. I know it's for advertising, but it's annoying!


h2. Get it.

Just hit download link from this page: https://github.com/ariefbayu/Indowebster-Direct-URL-Extractor

h2. Use it.

To you it, extract the downloaded file somewhere on your system and then:
<pre>$python idws.py http://indowebster.com/some_download_url_you_want_to_extract.html</pre>

The script will then output 2 lines of data consisting of the direct url in first line and it's filename in second line.

h2. Contribute!
