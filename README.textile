h1. Indowebster Direct URL Extractor

idws.py is simple script that will extract direct download url and it's filename from any given indowebster's download url

h2. Why?

I'm tired of the complicated step just to get the URL. I know it's for advertising, but it's annoying!


h2. Get it.

Just hit download link from this page: https://github.com/ariefbayu/Indowebster-Direct-URL-Extractor

h2. Use it.

To you it, extract the downloaded file somewhere on your system and then:


@$python idws.py -u http://indowebster.com/some_download_url_you_want_to_extract.html@

Will output two lines of data consisting of the direct download URL in first line and it's filename in second line

@$python idws.py -u http://indowebster.com/some_download_url_you_want_to_extract.html -w@

Will output single line of data in _wget_ format

@$python idws.py -u http://indowebster.com/some_download_url_you_want_to_extract.html -w -e "--limit-rate=10K"@

Will output single line of data in _wget_ format with supplied additional parameter 

h2. Contribute!
